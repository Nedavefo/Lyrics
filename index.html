                <p>Wait right here<br>
                I'll be back in the mornin'<br>
                I know that I'm not that important to you<br>
                But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous (yeah)<br><br>
                So much more than perfect (yeah)<br>
                Right now I know that I'm not really worth it<br>
                If you give me time, I could work on it<br>
                Give me some time while I work on it<br><br>
                Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you<br>
                The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me (yeah)<br>
                Look at my face when I fuck on your waist<br>
                'Cause we only have one conversation a week<br><br>
                That's why your friends always hatin' on me<br>
                Fuck 'em though, no I did this all by myself<br>
                Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help<br>
                And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings<br><br>
                None of my exes is over Lil Peep<br>
                Nobody flexin' as much as I be<br>
                That's why she text me and tell me she love me<br>
                She know that someday I'll be over the sea<br><br>
                Makin' my money and smokin' my weed<br>
                I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me<br>
                Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me<br>
                I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be<br><br>
                If I find a way, would you walk it with me?<br>
                Look at my face while you talkin' to me<br>
                'Cause we only have one conversation a week<br><br>
                Can I get one conversation at least?<br>
                Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach<br>
                This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces<br><br>
                Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason<br>
                A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces<br>
                Look at the sky tonight, all of those stars have a reason</p>
